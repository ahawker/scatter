# Scatter

Applications without borders.


## Goals
Scatter is a collection of Python packages aimed at making development of
distributed applications difficult and quite painful.
We sincerely hope you become physically ill during the process.


## Extensions
The base Scatter repository is more or less a collection of *glue* modules which define conventions
for how applications should interact. Scatter extensions are the implementations of these conventions
which integrate key pieces of technology helpful to developers.

Official Extensions:

-  [scatter-async](https://github.com/scatter/scatter-async) -- Asynchronous job/task worker pool support.

-  [scatter-threading](https://github.com/scatter/scatter-threading) -- Threading extensions for `scatter-async`.

-  [scatter-multiprocessing](https://github.com/scatter/scatter-multiprocessing) -- Multiprocessing extensions for `scatter-async`.

-  [scatter-gevent](https://github.com/scatter/scatter-gevent) -- Gevent extensions for `scatter-async`.

-  [scatter-eventlet](https://github.com/scatter/scatter-eventlet) -- Eventlet extensions for `scatter-async`.

-  [scatter-zeromq](https://github.com/scatter/scatter-zeromq) -- [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) support.


## Reviews

Some testimonials of developers currently using Scatter to build applications.

"Helped me get my first startup off the ground. It's a mat with services on it that you can *jump* to." - Tom Smykowski
"LOOKOUT! Arughharhgh" - Arnold Schwarzenegger


## Airing of Grievances

I've always felt that open source projects should have a section dedicated to complaints from the authors.
An area where one can admit mistakes, discuss design decisions and groan about code smells. A place
where you can complain out loud about your own code six months from now.

Let me get the pole out from the crawl space and let's wrestle.

### Complains

- Too heavily class based. This is Python, not Java.


## Status
- Under serious, backwards compatibility breaking changes. Use at your own risk.
