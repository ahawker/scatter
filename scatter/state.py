    Descriptor which allows users to decorate multiple functions to compose a state transition. Transitions
    are composed of up to four separate functions:

    condition -> Callable to return a bool which denotes if the transition should be executed.
    enter -> Callable to be executed before the action.
    action -> The meat of the transition.
    exit -> Callable to be executed after the action.

    Example:

    class LightSwitch(object):
        state = 'off'

        @transition('off', 'on')
        def on(self):
